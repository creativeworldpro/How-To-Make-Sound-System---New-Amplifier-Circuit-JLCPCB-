# How-To-Make-Sound-System---New-Amplifier-Circuit-JLCPCB-
In this project, weâ€™ll teach you making a simple 12v amplifier circuit. To make this circuit we are using transistor. If you have DC-12v adapter or 12v battery, then you also can make this amplifier circuit at home easily. And by using a DC-12v transformer you can easily make a powerful power supply for the circuit.
